### 2.1 A Brief History

“If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.”
John McCarthy,1961

“As of now, computer networks are still in their infancy, but as they grow up and become sophisticated, we will probably see the spread of 'computer utilities' …”
Leonard Kleinrock
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network

In the 1990s Salesforce.com pioneered the notion of bringing remotely provisioned services. In 2002 Amazon.com launched the AWS platform (Amazon Web Services), which provided remotely provisioned storage, computing resources and business functionality.
 
The term “Network Cloud” or “Cloud” was introduced in the 1990’s in the networking industry. In 2006 “cloud computing” emerged in the commercial arena, and during this time Amazon launched its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services), and also Google Apps began providing browser-based enterprise applications.

A concise definition of cloud computing:

“Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning scalable and measured resources.”
Forrester Research
