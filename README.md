### 2.1 A Brief History

“If computers of the kind I have advocated become the computers of the future, then computing may someday be organized as a public utility just as the telephone system is a public utility... The computer utility could become the basis of a new and important industry.”
John McCarthy,1961

“As of now, computer networks are still in their infancy, but as they grow up and become sophisticated, we will probably see the spread of 'computer utilities' …”
Leonard Kleinrock
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network

In the 1990s Salesforce.com pioneered the notion of bringing remotely provisioned services. In 2002 Amazon.com launched the AWS platform (Amazon Web Services), which provided remotely provisioned storage, computing resources and business functionality.
 
The term “Network Cloud” or “Cloud” was introduced in the 1990’s in the networking industry. In 2006 “cloud computing” emerged in the commercial arena, and during this time Amazon launched its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services), and also Google Apps began providing browser-based enterprise applications.

A concise definition of cloud computing:

“Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning scalable and measured resources.”
Forrester Research



### 2.2 Business Drivers
 #### Business Drivers
Before learning the layers of technologies that embody clouds, it is important to learn what led to their creation. Many of these business drivers are present in this section. 
It is important to know that these influences shaped clouds and the overall cloud computing from both ends. They have motivated organizations to adopt cloud computing and have motivated other organizations to be providers of cloud environments and cloud technology vendors.

#### Capacity Planning
It is the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization’s IT resources, products and services. 
It represents the maximum amount of work that an IT resource is capable of delivering in a given period of time. Not knowing the capacity of an IT resource can cause a system becoming inefficient (over-provisioning) or unable to fulfill user needs (under-provisioning). 
Capacity planning is focused on minimizing the discrepancy to achieve predictable efficiency and performance.
Capacity planning strategies :
-Lead Strategy: adding capacity to an IT resource in anticipation of demand.
-Lag Strategy: adding capacity when the IT resource reaches its full capacity.
-Match Strategy: adding IT resource capacity in small increments, as demand increases.


#### Cost Reduction
Two costs need to be accounted for: the cost of acquiring new infrastructure, and the cost of its ongoing ownership. Operational overhead represents a considerable share of IT burgers, often exceeding up-in front investment costs.

Common forms of infrastructure-related operating overhead include the following:
-technical personnel required to keep the environment operational
-upgrades and patches that introduce additional testing and deployment cycles
-utility bills and capital expense investments for power and cooling
-security and access control measures that need to be maintained and enforced to protect infrastructure resources
-administrative and accounts staff that may be required to keep track of licenses and support arrangements


#### Organizational Agility
Businesses need the ability to adapt and evolve to successfully face change caused by internal and external factors. 
 “Organizational agility is the measure of an organization's responsiveness to change.”
changing business needs and priorities may require IT resources to be more available and reliable than before.
